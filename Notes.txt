Automate determining whether there is a git -- do I have to include git in the packge?  Its 44MB.
The git.exe in D;\Program Files\Git\cmd is 40k in size.  But does it need other things for it to work?

clone command: git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2

What needs done to bundle this all together including the databawe and git?

Need to write replacements into a table?

Need to add last replacement date into config and check the date of the file at startup.
If the replacement.csv is new, then a full refresh should be prompted since it potentially affects older, existing data.
